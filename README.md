# Sidecar Toggler
(forked from [rauls4/Toggle-Sidecar-Automator-Workflow](https://github.com/rauls4/Toggle-Sidecar-Automator-Workflow). The credit of the AppleScript code all goes to [rauls4](https://github.com/rauls4) and all I know is to just save it as an application, and done localization for my compatriots.)

Use this script-app to quickly toggle the use of Sidecar to your iPad. You can add it to your Dock for quick access.

Do remember that this is made of AppleScript and it highly depends on what strings are displayed on Sidecar pref pane and even the title of the Sidecar pane itself. **So do download the proper version for your language. I only made English and Taiwan Chinese (zh-tw), and the rest is up to you.**
